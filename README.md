Seconded cars Price Prediction in python
<h5>This my College Mini-project.In this project, we have used various pre-processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict the price of used cars using sci-kit libraries from python.</h5>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<h5>These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.</h5>
<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<ol>
<li>Python 3.8.3
This setup requires that your machine has python 3.6 installed on it. you can refer to this url https://www.python.org/downloads/ to download python. Once you have python downloaded and installed, you will need to setup PATH variables (if you want to run python program directly, detail instructions are below in how to run software section). To do that check this: https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/.
Setting up PATH variable is optional as you can also run program without it and more instruction are given below on this topic.</li>
